This directory contains a collection of Lookup Table (LUT) files that
can be used with MayaVi.  Along with each LUT file is also a JPEG
screenshot using which you can preview the LUT using a file/image
browser.  Currently, all the LUTs have 256 colors.

To use the LUT in MayaVi simply select the required LUT file after
clicking the "Load Lookup Table" button of the scalar or vector legend
configuration dialog.

Please note that the LUTs here are currently in a temporary phase.
Some might be modified or removed in the future.  So if you
particularly like some of the LUTs you are encouraged to keep a copy
safely somewhere.

These LUTs were contributed by Fernando Perez, who in turn modified
and used Arnd Baecker's code to generate them.  Arnd Baecker used code
from gnuplot written by Petr Mikulik as a reference.
