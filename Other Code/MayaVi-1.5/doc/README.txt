		 The MayaVi Data Visualizer
		^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MayaVi is a free, easy to use scientific data visualizer.  It is
written in Python and uses the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) for the
graphics.  It provides a GUI written using Tkinter.  MayaVi is free
and distributed under a BSD style license.  It is also cross platform
and should run on any platform where both Python and VTK are available
(which is almost any *nix, Mac OS X and Windows).

The MayaVi home page can be found here:

       http://mayavi.sourceforge.net


This "doc" directory contains information on MayaVi, a document on
installation instructions and a users guide.

The install.html document has some simple installation instructions
for MayaVi.

The "guide" directory contains the MayaVi users guide.  Point your
browser to "guide/index.html" in order to read the users guide.  This
should also be accessible via MayaVi itself from the "Help" menu.  A
PDF version of the guide is available at the MayaVi web-site.

The "luts" directory inside the root source directory contains a
collection of lookup tables.  Read the README.txt in that directory
for more information.

Have fun!
