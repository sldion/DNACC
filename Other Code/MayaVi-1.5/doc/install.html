    <h1>MayaVi Installation Instructions</h1>
   
    <p>
      The MayaVi home page is at: 
      <a href="http://mayavi.sourceforge.net">
	http://mayavi.sourceforge.net</a>.  Please visit there for the
	latest information on MayaVi.  This document describes the
	installation procedures for MayaVi.
    </p>

  <p> 
    There are currently three ways of installing MayaVi.
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="#binary">As a stand-alone binary.</a> </li>
      
      <li> <a href="#package">Using RPMs, debs or Enthon</a> </li>

      <li> <a href="#source">From source as a Python module.</a> </li>
    </ul>
    The stand-alone binaries are available for Win32 and Linux.  They
    allow you to install MayaVi as an application without having to
    install VTK or even Python!  If you are going to use MayaVi as a
    Python module then you <b>must</b> install it using the other methods.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="binary">Installation as a binary</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    Currently there are two binaries available.  One for Win32 and the
    other for Linux.  The Linux and Win32 binaries were made using
    Gordon McMillan's <a
    href="http://www.mcmillan-inc.com/install1.html">Installer</a>.
    The Windows installer was made using <a
    href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php">InnoSetup</a>.
    Installing the binaries is pretty straight forward.  The download
    is pretty big since it comes bundled with everything necessary to
    run MayaVi.  Please note that when you install the binary, you
    <b>cannot</b> use MayaVi as a Python module from an existing
    installation of Python.  If you want that, you must install MayaVi
    from the other installation methods.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Both the binary installations ship with a <em>doc/</em> directory
    containing a quick installation guide, README, etc. and a user
    guide in <em>doc/guide/book1.html</em>.  Also included is an
    <em>examples/</em> directory that contains a sample VTK data file
    of a heart CT scan and a visualization based on that data.
  </p>

  <h3>Binary installation under Windows</h3>
  
  <p>
    Just <a
    href="http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/download.html">download</a>
    the binary, run it to start the installation, answer the questions
    on where you want to install it etc.  That's it!  If you have
    problems, please let us know.
  </p>

  <h3>Binary installation under Linux</h3>

  <p>
    Installing the Linux binary is also fairly straightforward.  The
    Linux binary is simply a bzipped tarball.  Untar it and run the
    <em>mayavi</em> program in the untarred directory.  The binary
    requires the following:
    <ul>
      <li> glibc2.3.2.  This should be standard on most recent Linux
      installations.</li>

      <li> Mesa/OpenGL: You will need to have libGL.so.1, libGLU.so.1
      and libGLcore.so.1 installed.</li>
      
      <li> X11: You will need to have the X libraries installed.  The
      binaries were built with XFree86 4.3.  I guess XFree86 4.x
      should work okay. </li>
    </ul>

    The above requirements are usually satisfied on almost any
    reasonably recent Linux machine.  If you have the above installed
    MayaVi should run fine.  In case you want to install MayaVi in a
    system wide location its best to install it somewhere and then
    copy the shell script <em>mayavi</em> thats in the tarball to
    /usr/local/bin/ (or /usr/bin/) and edit it to use the directory
    where the executable <em>mayavi.exe</em> is actually installed.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="package">Using RPMs, debs or Enthon</a></h2>

    <h3><a name="rpm"> RPM </a></h3>
    <p>
      Installing the RPM requires that you have installed Python,
      Tkinter and the <a
      href="http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/vtk/">VTK RPMs</a> for VTK
      and VTK-Python.  Once you have these working you can simply
      install the appropriate (depending on your Python version)
      MayaVi RPM.  If you have installed VTK from the sources and not
      via RPMS there should be no problem with installing the MayaVi
      RPM.
    </p>
    
    <h3><a name="deb"> Debian package </a></h3>
    <p>
      To install the Debian package simply install the current Debian
      MayaVi package (using apt-get install mayavi).  This will rope
      in all necessary dependencies.  Then simply install the
      downloaded Debian package.  Debian (woody) ships with VTK 3.2.
      More recent VTK 4.x binaries (not debs) that work under testing
      (for the i386) are available <a
      href="http://mayavi.sf.net/dwnld/vtk/"> here</a>.  These
      binaries are built under testing.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="enthon"> Enthought Python for Windows </a></h3>
    <p>
      Enthought distributes an <a
      href="http://www.enthought.com/python/">enhanced Python
      installer</a> that ships with a huge number of very useful
      Python packages.  If you install this, you get a fully
      functional Python installation with MayaVi installed.  Since all
      MayaVi's requirements are installed as part of Enthon, if you
      need to upgrade the version of MayaVi that ships with Enthon,
      you can simply install MayaVi from sources by following the
      instructions in the <a href="installation">installation of
      MayaVi</a> section.
    </p>

  <h2> <a name="source">Installation from Sources</a></h2>

  <p>
    MayaVi uses <a
    href="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/">distutils</a> for
    the installation process.  Distutils is part of the Python
    standard library from versions 2.0 onwards.  So, you should
    normally have this available.  MayaVi requires that VTK be
    installed and usable from Python.  For more details please read
    the MayaVi <a href="#requirements">requirements</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
      If you would like to install MayaVi from the sources under
      Debian GNU/Linux you may simply run 
  
  <h3><a name="installation">Installation of MayaVi</a></h3>

  <p>
    If the <a href="#requirements">requirements</a> are all met,
    installing MayaVi is simple.  <a
    href="http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/download.html">Download</a>
    the tarball, untar/unzip it, change directory to the new directory
    and do the following:
    <pre>
      % python setup.py install
    </pre>
    Thats all there is to it.  Under Linux you might want to run this
    command as root.  For more help on the various options for the
    install command try this:
    <pre>
      % python setup.py install --help
    </pre>
    For more help on distutils look <a
    href="http://python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/doc/">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that if you simply want to run MayaVi without
    installing it as a module you can always run it straight from the
    untarred directory like so:
    <pre>
      % mayavi [options]
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you have MayaVi installed and running, you can test it by
    using the example files in the <em>examples/</em> directory of the
    sources.  The directory contains a sample VTK data file of a heart
    CT scan and a visualization based on that data.  To run this
    visualization use the <em>File->Load->Visualization</em> menu and
    choose the example in the <em>examples</em> directory of the
    MayaVi source tree.  If this loads fine then you are all set!  For
    more information on how to use MayaVi read the <a
    href="docs/guide/book1.html">MayaVi users guide</a>.  This guide
    is also included along with the source and is in the
    <em>doc/guide/</em> directory.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> MayaVi requires:
	<ul>
	  <li> Python version >= 2.0  and a working Tkinter.</li>
	    
          <li> A working <a
          href="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/">distutils</a>. 
          </li>

	  <li> The VTK library with the Python bindings, the
	  VTK-Python Tk widget, and the VTK contrib library compiled.
	  Under VTK 4.x you also need to compile the Hybrid classes
	  (there is no 'contrib' directory in VTK 4.x) to get all the
	  MayaVi modules to work.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li> MayaVi runs fine under Linux and the Windows (TM) operating
      system.  There are reports that it works on other Unix systems
      too.  Technically, it should have no problems running on any
      platform where VTK and Python are available.</li>

      <li> Both the latest stable releases and the nightly VTK 4.x CVS
      tree builds work fine.</li>

    </ul> 
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Usually the hardest part of a MayaVi install when using the
    sources is getting the VTK Python bindings installed properly.
    The next section tries to address this.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="install_vtk">Installation of VTK</a> </h3>
    
  <p>
    Before you can run MayaVi you need to have VTK installed and
    working properly.  There are two ways to install VTK on any
    platform.  One way is to build the packages from the sources and
    the other is to download pre-built binary packages.  VTK is a huge
    package and building from source is not for the weak hearted.  You
    can download binaries and sources from <a
    href="http://www.vtk.org/get-software.php"> the VTK
    download page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instructions on how to build VTK suitably under Windows for MayaVi
    are available <a
    href="http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/BuildingVTKOnWin32">here</a>.
    You should also read the README.html that is included with the VTK
    sources.  When building VTK from the sources make sure that you
    build the Python bindings.  It is a good idea to build the Tcl
    bindings also since that ensures that the VTK-Python Tk widgets
    are also compiled.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pre-built VTK packages are available for Linux and Win32 and these
    are mentioned below.  If installing VTK from sources is a hassle
    you should consider trying these instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    <dl>
      <dt> <b>Linux binaries</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Links to nightly RPMS are available from the <a
        href="http://www.vtk.org/get-software.php"> VTK download
        page</a>.  A tarball containing all the necessary
        libraries/modules in order to use VTK from Python is available
        <a href="http://mayavi.sf.net/dwnld/vtk/">here</a>.  This
        build uses the latest CVS tree and has been built on the
        Debian GNU/Linux woody distribution.  More details on the
        installation etc. are available in the README.txt included at
        the site.
      </dd>

      <dt> <b>Binaries for Windows</b> </dt>
      <dd>
	Windows binaries are also available at the <a
	href="http://www.vtk.org/get-software.php"> VTK download
	page</a>.  Some old windows binaries for VTK-Python should be
	available from <a
	href="http://mayavi.sf.net/dwnld/vtk/win32/">here</a>.  This
	package has all the necessary items for MayaVi compiled in.
	Instructions on how to install it are available at the
	site. You might also be interested in checking out <a
	href="http://www.enthought.com/python/">Enthought's Enhanced
	Python</a> distribution.  MayaVi should be easy to install
	from source if you are using this.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p> The Linux and Win32 binaries pages should be updated
    reasonably often so do check them out.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="test_vtk">Testing your VTK installation</a></h3>

    <p>
      Included along with the MayaVi source is a file called
      test_vtk.py in the doc directory.  Run this to test your VTK
      installation like so:
    </p>
      <pre>
      % python test_vtk.py
      </pre>
    <p>
      If this runs without problems then your VTK installation is ok.
      You should then <a href="#source">install MayaVi from the
      source</a> and try to run it.  If you have trouble the script
      will tell you where it failed.  At this point if you are unable
      to proceed <a href="mailto:mayavi-users@lists.sf.net">email
      us</a>.  You might also want to check the <a
      href="../cgi-bin/moin.cgi">MayaVi Wiki.</a>
