    * MayaVi 1.5 release.
    
    * Added new LUT editor contributed by Gerald Knizia and Arnd
      Baecker.  The LUT editor allows one to edit the colors in RGB or
      HSV mode.  The editor can also be used standalone.

    * Added support to easily add user defined sources (works just
      like the user defined modules and filters).  Contributed by Ross
      Harder.

    * Support for VolumeProMapper contributed by Daniel James White
      and Heikki Uuksulainen.

    * Added a Vorticity filter contributed by Gareth Clay that
      computes the vorticity of input vector data.

    * Updated MayaVi and vtkPipeline to work with VTK-CVS and VTK-5.x.
      Support for VTK versions < 4.0 has been removed.  MayaVi and the
      pipeline browser will continue to work with VTK-4.x.

    * Added a utility vtk_doc.py script that allows one to search the
      VTK class docs from a GUI.

    * Fixed severe bug in opening time series data files under Windows.

    * Fixed various other bugs (details in full changelog).


Tue Feb 1 20:56:22 2005 Prabhu Ramachandran <prabhu_r@users.sf.net>

    * MayaVi 1.4 release.

    * Support for data files belonging to a time series.  It is now
      possible to sweep through the time series.  Thanks to Gerard
      Gorman for an initial patch.

    * Support for user defined modules and filters.  A search path may
      be specifed in the preferences.  User defined modules and
      filters are searched for in these directories.  These user
      defined filters and modules are listed inside a 'User' sub-menu
      of the Filter and Module menus.  Thanks to Fernando Perez
      for an initial patch.

    * Fixed critical bugs in the Volume module.

    * Miscellaneous enhancements: allow the user to disable rendering
      temporarily, user can specify geometry of the MayaVi window.
      
    * Several other bug fixes and minor enhancements.


Tue Nov 18 14:20:46 2003 Prabhu Ramachandran <prabhu_r@users.sf.net>

    * MayaVi 1.3 release.

    * New Modules:
      - Volume: Volume visualization using either texture or ray cast
        mappers.  A useful GUI color transfer function editor is also
        built-in.
      - Glyph: Generic glyphs for scalars and vectors.
      - BandedSurfaceMap: Display banded contours of input data.
      - Labels: Automatic labeling of data used in other modules.
      - Text: Display 2D text strings.

    * New Filters:
      - ExtractGrid: Select part of a grid or subsample it.
      - StructuredPointsProbe: Probes any input data onto a structured
        points grid so the data can be used for Volume visualization.
      - Delaunay3D/Delaunay2D: Triangulate input point data.
      - UserDefined: Manage any user specified VTK filter.
      - CutPlane: Cut through any input dataset with a plane.

    * Support for VTK's new XML based files and for EnSight case files
      (EnSight6 and EnSightGold formats are supported).

    * Improved VectorCutPlane and VelocityVector so you can use a 3D
      arrow and any of the standard 2D glyphs.

    * The 'imv' module is now part of the mayavi.tools package.  imv
      is a simple MayaVi based module that provides Matlab like one
      liners to view 2D surfaces and arrays from the Python
      interpreter.

    * Support to save rendered scene to vector EPS/PS/PDF or save the
      text to TeX output using GL2PS.  Requires VTK to be built with
      GL2PS support (the MayaVi binaries support this).  Also added
      support for exporting to a Wavefront OBJ file.

    * Support to save the stereo rendering options, the lookup table
      settings and the lighting as defaults.
    
    * Default lookup tables should have more contrast.  28 user
      contributed lookup tables are included in the sources.  Any
      lookup table can be reversed.

    * Improved vtkPipeline modules:
      - ConfigVtkObj: Separated functionality of the ConfigVtkObj
        class into a separate ConfigVtkObjFrame and a driver class.
        More options to generate GUI's automatically.
      - VtkPickler: Can save/load state from a dictionary.

    * Fixes for Python-2.3 and Tk-8.4 related changes.

    * Fixes for the Mac OS X.

    * Many other fixes and improvements.


Tue Jun 11 11:55:04 2002 Prabhu Ramachandran <prabhu_r@users.sf.net>

    (*) MayaVi 1.2 release.

    (*) Changed license from GPL/LGPL to BSD.

    (*) Added an integrated data picker.  Thanks to Jose Paulo for
    initial contributions.

    (*) Added a light control toolkit (contributed by Raymond Maple).
    This lets you configure 8 different lights using a GUI.

    (*) Added a CellData to PointData filter.

    (*) Fixed bad problem in the lookup table editor that would freeze
    MayaVi under Win32.

    (*) The scalar/vector range can be set to predetermined values.  A
    visible range for data can also be specified.  Anything outside
    this range is made transparent.

    (*) Added --display and --geometry command line options.

    (*) Geomview OOGL export option (thanks to Jeremy Gill).

    (*) Made it easier to animate mayavi from a script.

    (*) Added help menu and use webbrowser to show docs.

    (*) Default dir now set to empty.

    (*) PDF documentation now available.

    (*) Thanks to Maitland Bottoms MayaVi is now distributed as part
    of Debian GNU/Linux!

    (*) RPM and Debian packages are available in addition to source
    and binary releases for Win32 and GNU/Linux.



Sat Nov 17 16:47:51 2001 Prabhu Ramachandran <prabhu_r@users.sf.net>

    (*) MayaVi 1.1.
     
    (*) MayaVi can now be installed as a stand-alone binary without the
    user needing to install Python or VTK.  Made thanks to Gordon
    McMillan's Installer.

    (*) Can now be used from other Python programs and can be
    scripted.  Could also be used interactively from the Python
    interpreter.

    (*) Installs as a Python package using distutils.

    (*) Quite a few useful command line arguments are now supported.

    (*) Added 3D Studio file import, RenderMan RIB/JPEG/PNG
    export.

    (*) Cleaned up the pickled output of the vtkPickler.  Also cleaned
    up the vtkMethodParser and the vtkPipeline classes.

    (*) Huge speed up (by a factor of 50 or more) in the "expand all"
    feature of the pipeline browser, thanks to Dan Blezek
    <blezek@crd.ge.com>.

    (*) Modified the streamlines so that a DiskSource is used when we
    have 2D data this also fixes a previous problem with 2D data.

    (*) Add support for using RungeKutta 4th order integration in the
    streamline module.
    
    (*) Intelligently disable useless VTK warning messages that are
    shown when the pickler or the vtkPipeline code is used by turning
    these messages off using the GlobalWarningDisplay flag
    appropriately.

    (*) Automatic hot-key finding for module and filter menus.

    (*) Added options to place the vector glyphs such that they start,
    end or are centered at a grid point.

    (*) Added filters: PolyDataNormals, WarpVector, WarpScalar,
    ExtractUnstructuredGrid.  Added module: WarpVectorCutPlane.

    (*) Added utility module, ivtk.py, that makes interactive VTK a
    pleasure.

    (*) New VtkData Source class that handles user given vtkData.
    This is very useful when MayaVi is run from other programs and
    does not use a data file based input.

    (*) Added basic Tensor support, a tensor related filter and module.
    All of which were contributed by Jose Paulo
    <moitinho@civil.ist.utl.pt> - many thanks!

    (*) Fixed various bugs.

    (*) Updated the user guide, web pages etc.



Sun May 13 00:52:07 2001  Prabhu Ramachandran <prabhu_r@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Releasing MayaVi 1.0.
	
	* This is the first release of MayaVi.  The news logs are before
	this entry are for the predecessor of MayaVi, VTK-CFD.  MayaVi is
	based on ideas from VTK-CFD but has a completely rewritten code
	base.
	
	* Completely rewrote/redesigned the vtk-cfd code and renamed the
	resulting project MayaVi.  There are so many features that have
	been added that it is hard to keep track.  This list presents some
	of the most important new features.

	* Much improved GUI.

	* Support for using multiple visualization modules and multiple
	data sources simultaneously.

	* Support for saving and reloading of either the entire
	visualization or a part of it.

	* Improved modules with more features.

	* Uses a new and improved pipeline browser (v1.1) along with a
	pipeline segment browser.

	* Support for filtering data along with a few simple filters.

	* Support for importing a VRML scene (thanks to Dr. P. A. Rubini
	for his suggestions).

	* Simple animation of data using autosweep of slider values
	(thanks again to Dr. P. A. Rubini for his suggestions and sample
	code.)
	
	* The ability to reload _all_ used modules on the fly.  The code
	is import safe.

    thanks to Dr. M. Fatica for his suggestions.

    * Added support for exporting to a Post Script file.
